# Material Database Overlay

**Target:** `orpen-sc-pdk` and `gsim`

**Status:** candidate

SCQ material records should live in the PDK. Reusable material resolution,
frequency evaluation, and Palace material translation should live in `gsim`.

The integration should preserve `materials.json` style data sources when they
are introduced, rather than treating them as generated artifacts.

Acceptance direction:

- `orpen-sc-pdk` publishes only public material names, aliases, and parameter
  records;
- `gsim` loads PDK material overlays, applies frequency-dependent evaluation,
  and writes Palace material blocks;
- material provenance is visible in generated configs and reports;
- private material overlays can be mounted locally without becoming part of the
  public PDK.
